# Artificial Intelligence for Reversi 

## 1. Description of the Project

[//]: # "What was the purpose of the project?" 
The purpose of the project is to build an Artificial Intelligence which plays the board game called Reversi. An heuristics approach was used. Also the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was implemented.

[//]: # "What your application does?" 


[//]: # "What problem does it solve" 


[//]: # "What was your motivation?" 


[//]: # "Why did you build this project?" 


[//]: # "Building Procedure" 


[//]: # "Project Strucuture" 



## 2. Technologies Used

[//]: # "What technologies were used?" 
In order to build this project, Python was used. 

[//]: # "Why you used the technologies you used?" 


[//]: # "Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future." 





## 3. Learning outcomes

[//]: # "What did you learn?" 
The main learning outcomes were:
- Deepen my knowledge using Python.
- Building algorithms such as the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- How to build useful heuristics to solve hard problems using Artificial Intelligence. 


## 4. How to Install and Run
In order to run the program, Python 3.7 or higher is needed. In order to run a tournament where all the Heuristics defined inside the tournament directory compete against each other, you can run:
```
python3 demo_tournament.py
```
The result will show a table in which the results of the games between each of the players (or heuristics)
 are shown.
